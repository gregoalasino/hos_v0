// The three sizes are presented as figures, not as price cards. Prices are
// deliberately absent: they are read from Supabase and rendered on /paquetes,
// so repeating them here would guarantee a stale number on the landing the
// first time the studio adjusts them.
//
// Nothing in this file draws a line. What the hairlines used to do is done by
// two things and only two.
//
// Alignment, for the vertical rule: every numeral starts on the section's left
// margin, every unit label on a second edge, every line of copy on a third.
// Two edges facing each other across white space are what the eye reads as a
// line, which is why the rule was redundant in the first place.
//
// A ratio of space, for the horizontal rules. Three tiers, each about double
// the one below it: 8-16px inside a size, 48-64px between two sizes, 96-128px
// between blocks. Proximity is read before weight or alignment, so as long as
// each tier is unambiguously larger than the one under it the grouping is
// legible without a stroke. The section's own py-20/28 sits between two
// neighbours with the same padding, so the seam is 160-224px of combined air:
// still the largest gap in play, which keeps the block from bleeding into the
// section above it.

                  88px burgundy figures would be the loudest thing on the page

                  tabular-nums plus a min measure of 2.4 digits is the whole
                  alignment device: every numeral box is the same width whether
                  it holds one digit or two, so the unit labels line up on a
                  second edge and the copy on a third. min-w rather than w, so
                  an unexpected glyph width in the display face pushes the box
